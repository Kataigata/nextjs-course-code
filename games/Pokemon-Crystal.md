Pokemon Crystal is part of the 2nd generation of mainline pokemon games.

I did train a bit towards the last gym in this game since facing the pokemon league with under level 40 pokemon
didn't seem like the best idea. yes I was under level 40 after the last gym.
The levels in this game are so low!

the first gym is level 7. Compared to level 16 in the next generation game.

The interesting part of this game is when you've done the pokemon league you can go back
and do all the gym leaders from the last game. However it's pretty easy to clear them instantly.
They then expect you to go and defeat Red who is level 80 whilst you are still around 50-60 and
training is a pain in this game so no thank you.

I didn't bother with the legendary pokemon in this one since it has a day night cycle which
was annoying and I was so done with it. sprites and colours improved on last gen but doesn't
feel majorly like a different game.
